% Mochiweb websocket example
%
% [1]: At first you have to start HTTP server which will listen for HTTP requests
%      and eventually upgrade connection to websocket
% [2]: Attempt to upgrade connection to websocket. 
%      Function mochiweb_websocket:upgrade_connection/2:
%      * first argument is mochiweb_request
%      * second is M:F which will handle further websocket messages. 
%      Function return two funs:
%      * ReentryWs/1 - use it to enter to messages handling loop (in this example ws_loop/3)
%      * ReplyChannel/1 - use to send messages to client. May be passed to other processes
% [3]: Example of sending message to client
% [4]: State that will be passed to message handling loop
% [5]: Pass controll to messages handling loop. From this moment each message received from client
%      can be handled...
% [6]: ...here as Payload. State is variable intended for holiding your custom state. ReplyChannel 
%      is the same function as in [3]. 
%      Notice! Payload is list of messages received from client. Websocket framing mechanism 
%      concatenates messages which are sent one after another in short time.
% [7]: Print payload received from client and send it back
% [8]: Message handling function must return new state value
